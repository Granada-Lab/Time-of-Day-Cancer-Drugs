        * drug was not uniformly tested for other cell lines
    - 20220317_DR_”cellline”: all dose-response data was used except for Alpelisib due to testing of non-saturating dose range 
    - 20221026_DR_”cellline”: all dose-response data was used except for Everolimus due to no uniform testing of all cell lines
